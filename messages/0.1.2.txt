nRepeat Plugin version 0.1.2 (2014-03-15)

Fixed the issue where selected text would be deleted, when running this plugin.

Instead your text selections will now temporarily disappear when starting the
command and reappear on ending it. When inserting characters, while having a
region selected, the characters will be inserted in front of or behind the
region, always nearest to your text cursor. This works with multiple
selection regions.
